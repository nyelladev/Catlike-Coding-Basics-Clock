# Basic Unity Clock

This repository follows the basic clock tutorial from [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/).

# Important Unity Concepts to Remember
- **UnityEngine namespace** - Includes important unity class types such as MonoBehaviour
- **Transform** - Class that includes the position, rotation and scale of an Object. 
- **[SerializeField]** - Only public fields are serialized so private variables will require this to be exposed to Unity. Better to not make everything public so other classes can't modify everything.
- **Awake()** - Performs actions on script load.
- **Update()** - Called every frame.
  
# Important Graphic Concepts to Remember
- **Quaternion** - used to represent rotations. Does not experience gimbal lock.
- **local rotation** - rotation in association with an object.
- **world rotation** - rotation of an object in world space.

# Result 
**I wanted to have a little fun and made the clock rotate super fast**
